# VS Code Extension CI & E2E

How the VS Code extension is built, tested, and guarded against regression in
CI. This is the source of truth for the `vscode.yml` workflow shape and the
end-to-end test layers. Code-level facts live next to the code; this doc holds
the system/process decisions.

## Workflow organization

The repo convention: one big [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) holds **all**
per-package test jobs; standalone workflow files are reserved for **deploy /
release** concerns. The VS Code extension is the deliberate exception — it keeps
a **dedicated `vscode.yml`** so it remains an isolated, separately-required
status check that iterates independently of the main suite.

Because it is standalone, `vscode.yml` must still match `ci.yml`'s conventions:

- **Triggers:** `push` / `pull_request` on `branches: [main, vscode-extension]`,
  plus `merge_group` (so the merge queue gates on it) and
  `workflow_dispatch`. `vscode-extension` is transitional; narrow this back to
  `main` once the extension lands there.
- **No `paths:` filter.** `ci.yml` does not use them, and `paths` combined with
  `merge_group` can hang the merge queue (a path-filtered required check that
  never runs in the queue blocks the merge).
- **Concurrency:** `ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`,
  `cancel-in-progress` on pull requests.
- **Shared install:** a `.github/actions/npm-install` composite action wraps the
  Electron-retry `npm ci` for bash and pwsh, so the cross-platform retry loop is
  defined once instead of copy-pasted per job.

## Publish workflow

`.github/workflows/vscode-publish.yml` is a deploy workflow, not part of the
required test gate. It publishes `packages/vscode` from namespaced extension tags
like `vscode-v0.1.0`, keeping the extension's independent version track separate
from the monorepo's `v*` release tags.

Publish tags must satisfy all of the workflow's guards:

- The tag name matches `vscode-v*` and the concrete package version in
  `packages/vscode/package.json`.
- The tagged commit is reachable from `origin/vscode-extension`.
- The job uses the `marketplace` environment. A human approval is required only
  when that environment has protection rules configured; naming the environment
  in the workflow does not create an approval gate by itself.

The five non-extension workflows with broad `v*` push-tag triggers explicitly
exclude `vscode-v*`, so an extension release selects only this publisher.

Use a tag push for extension releases. A normal `workflow_dispatch` reruns a
specific already-created `vscode-v*` tag through the same validation and publish
path.

For read-only Marketplace diagnosis, manually dispatch the same workflow with an
existing `vscode-v*` tag and `diagnostic_only: true`. The job still checks out
and validates that tag and installs its pinned dependencies, but skips extension
build and publication. It instead records status/timing for a bounded anonymous
Gallery `OPTIONS` request, then runs `vsce verify-pat hinnes` with `VSCE_PAT` in
the step environment. The credential check still runs when the anonymous probe
fails, so both results remain visible; neither probe runs after checkout,
validation, or installation failure.

`verify-pat` accepts any publisher role, including Reader. Success therefore
shows that the token can access the publisher role API, but does not establish
Manage/publish permission or prove whether the Gallery endpoint has an ongoing
service issue. Environment approval is likewise conditional on the repository's
actual `marketplace` environment protection configuration.

## Why these tests: the regression map

The recent extension regressions all sit at the **extension ↔ app ↔ daemon
bridge** boundary or in **platform path handling** — exactly the seams unit
tests miss. Each e2e layer exists to guard a class of regression we already
shipped:

| Commit     | Regression                                                                                                                      | Guarded by                               |

## E2E layers

### Layer 1 — extension-host smoke (CI: ubuntu + windows)

Runs inside `vscode-smoke` through
[run-smoke-with-daemon.mjs](../packages/vscode/scripts/run-smoke-with-daemon.mjs),
which invokes the existing `@vscode/test-electron` smoke
([run-vscode-smoke.mjs](../packages/vscode/src/test/run-vscode-smoke.mjs) →
[vscode-smoke.ts](../packages/vscode/src/test/vscode-smoke.ts)). The smoke
launches real VS Code, activates the extension, opens the Paseo webview, and
asserts the webview HTML, CSP, runtime config, and bootstrap script. This catches
activation, render, and first-open-state regressions. Windows coverage also
catches Electron-launch and path issues.

Linux runs the smoke under `xvfb-run -a`; Windows runs the same script directly.
The job caches the `@vscode/test-electron` VS Code download at
`packages/vscode/.vscode-test`.

### Layer 2 — bridge round-trip vs a real daemon (CI: ubuntu + windows)

Also runs inside `vscode-smoke`. The wrapper
[run-smoke-with-daemon.mjs](../packages/vscode/scripts/run-smoke-with-daemon.mjs)
uses the shared
[daemon-harness.mjs](../packages/vscode/scripts/lib/daemon-harness.mjs) helper to
boot a real password-protected Paseo daemon on `127.0.0.1:6788`. The wrapper
creates a scratch user home, writes its home-relative `.paseo/config.json`, and
starts the daemon with `PASEO_PASSWORD` set. The smoke inherits that scratch
`HOME`/`USERPROFILE` and runs with
`PASEO_VSCODE_TEST_PASSWORD` set so `runBridgeRoundTrip`
([vscode-smoke.ts](../packages/vscode/src/test/vscode-smoke.ts)) executes.

This exercises **config discovery (the `~` expansion path) + the authenticated
transport handshake end-to-end** on Linux and Windows. Windows directly guards
the `da0be24d` class because the fixture writes the home-relative config path
that `expandHomePath` must resolve.

### Layer 3 — workspace-open + rich-transcript/file-link e2e (CI: ubuntu)

Runs in `vscode-e2e` via
[vscode-e2e.mjs](../packages/vscode/scripts/vscode-e2e.mjs). The script launches
real VS Code, connects Playwright over CDP with `connectOverCDP`, and runs
against a real password-protected daemon from the shared daemon harness.

Spec 1, **workspace-open**, is implemented and deterministic: open VS Code on a
fresh folder unknown to the daemon, assert the app leaves the splash, and assert
the workspace rendered. It uses the `startup-splash`, `workspace-header-title`,
`message-input-root`, and `workspace-tabs-row` `data-testid` markers, and treats
the workspace as ready when the splash is gone and any core workspace chrome is
present. This guards `a46672ad`.

Spec 2, **rich transcript and native file link**, creates a mock-provider agent
through the real daemon client API. Its streamed response contains Mermaid and a
line-targeted link to a generated file under `.github/`. The spec checks the
inline SVG while the Stop control proves the turn is still active, then checks
the completed fullscreen SVG and closes it. It also drops a `text/uri-list` URI
into the composer and checks the inserted file mention before clicking the
transcript link and checking the active VS Code editor path and line. Relevant
CSP console violations fail the spec, which captures success screenshots for
each surface.

The job uploads `packages/vscode/artifacts/vscode-e2e` on failure.

## Implementation order

1. **WS1 — done.** `.github/actions/npm-install` composite; `vscode.yml` has
   aligned triggers, three jobs, and the shared install action.
2. **WS2 — done.** `vscode-smoke` runs on ubuntu and windows; Linux uses
   `xvfb-run -a`; the VS Code test download is cached.
3. **WS3 — done.** The daemon helper boots a password-protected daemon, writes
   `~/.paseo/config.json`, wires `PASEO_PASSWORD`, and the smoke wires
   `PASEO_VSCODE_TEST_PASSWORD` for the bridge round-trip.
4. **WS4 — done.** `vscode-e2e` runs the CDP/Playwright harness on ubuntu and
   implements deterministic workspace-open and mock-agent rich transcript/file
   link specs.
5. **Remaining.** Optionally add Windows coverage for Layer 3 after proving the
   CDP workflow is stable there.
6. **Docs.** Keep this doc and [testing.md](testing.md) current as the remaining
   items land.

## Risk flags

- Linux display is resolved by using `xvfb-run -a` for both smoke and Layer 3;
  keep that wrapper unless a replacement is proven in CI.
- Windows home-path layout for `config.json` is covered by Layer 2. Keep the
  fixture at `~/.paseo/config.json` under the scratch home; never write the
  runner user's real config.
- Optional Windows coverage for Layer 3 remains unproven and should be added only
  after validating VS Code CDP stability on the Windows runner.

## CI gotchas

- The smoke/e2e daemon harness spawns the worker entry directly:
  `node packages/server/dist/server/server/daemon-worker.js` with
  `PASEO_HOME`, `PASEO_LISTEN`, `PASEO_PASSWORD`,
  `PASEO_LOCAL_SPEECH_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=0`, `PASEO_DICTATION_ENABLED=0`,
  `PASEO_VOICE_MODE_ENABLED=0`, and `ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL=skip`. Do not use
  `paseo daemon start`: `--foreground` exits code 0 almost immediately, and the
  detached start discards worker stderr so health cannot be detected. Running the
  worker directly serves `/api/health` in about 1s and logs to stdout; it requires
  `npm run build:server` first so the worker dist exists.
- In `packages/vscode/scripts/vscode-e2e.mjs` `openPaseo`, headless CI renders
  the webview reliably only after revealing the activity-bar Paseo view by
  clicking the `.activitybar` item whose `aria-label` contains `paseo`. Drive the
  command palette with real keystrokes after `Ctrl+Shift+P`:
  `keyboard.type("Paseo: Open")`; do not use Playwright `fill()`, which clobbers
  the `>` command prefix and can leave Enter unable to activate the highlighted
  command.
- Current macOS VS Code archives name the app executable `Contents/MacOS/Code`,
  while `@vscode/test-electron` 2.5.2 still returns the retired
  `Contents/MacOS/Electron` path. The smoke launcher resolves that renamed binary
  before calling `runTests`; removing the fallback makes local macOS smoke fail
  with `ENOENT` before extension activation.
- On `app-frame-not-found`, start with
  `packages/vscode/artifacts/vscode-e2e/frame-report.json` and the screenshot.
  The report lists every frame URL plus whether `window.paseoVscode` and `#root`
  are present.
